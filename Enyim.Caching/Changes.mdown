# Enyim Memcached Version History

## Version 2.8

 * Performance monitoring support. The included DefaultPerformanceMonitor will use Windows performance counters. See [the wiki](http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/Configure-the-Performance-Monitor) about configuring this feature.
 * Fixed a race condition in the InterlockedQueue. See [Bug #36](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues#issue/36). Thanks to [danp60](https://github.com/danp60).
 * Now it's possible to change the timeout for acquiring a socket from a full pool. This can help reduce the impact of a dead node on yor application. See the [memached/socketPool](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/MemcachedClient-Configuration) element on the wiki.
 * Fixed [Bug #37](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues#issue/37) - NLogFactory class name incorrect
 * Added some workarounds for undisposed clients blocking IIS application pool recycles causing 100% CPU spikes

## Version 2.7

 * Removed log4net from the project and made the log provider configurable. See http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/Configure-Logging
 * Fixed the config section to default to the Binary protocol. (The MemcachedClientConfiguration was already doing this for some time.)
 * The client no longer checks if objects are larger than 1MB, but lets the server sort it out
