# Enyim Memcached Version History

## Version 2.9

 * Fixed [Issue #48](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues#issue/37) -  Allow the socket pool use maxPoolSize number of sockets instead of (max - min).
 * Fixed the ObjectDisposedException coming from the DefaultNodeLocator.
 * Multi-get now uses [IOCP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365198\(v=vs.85\).aspx) instead of threads from the ThreadPool. Performance should be the comparable or better (depending on the amount of items and size).
 * New DataContractSerializer to enable caching of EntityFramework or LINQ to SQl entitites. See also [Issue #54](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues/54).
 * Items should always be hashed to the same node when using the KetamaNodeLocator. ([931f31ea07953f499eac](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/commit/931f31ea07953f499eacd2a6a55566dcb3e80384))
 * CasResult now contains the status code of Set/Add/Replace operations. ([bb0ca459e3e597897826](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/commit/bb0ca459e3e597897826905b63f6edfab21371e6))
 * Expirations specified in TimeSpans are not ilmited to 30 days.

## Version 2.8

 * Performance monitoring support. The included DefaultPerformanceMonitor will use Windows performance counters. See [the wiki](http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/Configure-the-Performance-Monitor) about configuring this feature.
 * Fixed a race condition in the InterlockedQueue. See [Bug #36](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues#issue/36). Thanks to [danp60](https://github.com/danp60).
 * Now it's possible to change the timeout for acquiring a socket from a full pool. This can help reduce the impact of a dead node on yor application. See the [memached/socketPool](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/MemcachedClient-Configuration) element on the wiki.
 * Fixed [Issue #37](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/issues#issue/37) - NLogFactory class name incorrect.
 * Added some workarounds for undisposed clients blocking IIS application pool recycles causing 100% CPU spikes.

## Version 2.7

 * Removed log4net from the project and made the log provider configurable. See http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/Configure-Logging
 * Fixed the config section to default to the Binary protocol. (The MemcachedClientConfiguration was already doing this for some time.)
 * The client no longer checks if objects are larger than 1MB, but lets the server sort it out.
