# Enyim Memcached Version History

## Version 2.7

 * Removed log4net from the project and made the log provider configurable. See http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/Configure-Logging
 * Fixed the config section to default to the Binary protocol. (The MemcachedClientConfiguration was already doing this for some time.)
 * The client no longer checks if objects are larger than 1MB, but lets the server sort it out
